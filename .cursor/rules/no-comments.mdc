# No Comments Rule

Do not add comments to code. Write self-documenting code instead.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive variable and function names that explain their purpose
- Break complex logic into well-named functions
- Use clear, expressive code structure
- If code needs explanation, refactor it to be clearer rather than adding comments

## Examples

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Using comments
// Calculate total price including tax
const total = price * 1.1;

// ✅ GOOD - Self-documenting code
const totalPriceWithTax = calculateTotalWithTax(basePrice);
```

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Comment explaining what code does
// Check if user is authenticated
if (user && user.token) {
  // ...
}

// ✅ GOOD - Clear conditional logic
const isUserAuthenticated = user?.token !== undefined;
if (isUserAuthenticated) {
  // ...
}
```

When writing code, prioritize clarity and self-documentation over comments.
